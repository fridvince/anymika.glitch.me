I wouldn't say I have any "useless" skills. Every step of my creative path has added depth to who I am today, a UI designer deeply rooted in a world of visual storytelling and digital craft. Before I ever stepped into user interface design, I worked with 3D graphics. Not as a detour, but as a natural extension of my curiosity, a way to shape environments, breathe life into objects, and communicate ideas through space and form.

In college, I spent countless hours drawing and painting, from human figures to nature, still lives to imagined scenes. Those years weren't just academic exercises, they were foundational. Through sketching and observation, I learned to see. That clarity of vision now permeates everything I do, from UI layouts to spatial compositions.

3D modelling became a passion that merged artistic sensibility with technical challenge. It allowed me to explore architectural forms, interior concepts, environmental storytelling, and art installations in a way that was both visual and tactile. Paired with 2D graphics, it felt like giving breath to static ideas, bringing them alive.

Even before all that, my earliest years were soaked in design, web layouts, digital ads, character modelling, cartooning. I was surrounded by media and absorbed it like a sponge, sketching out my own manga-inspired characters and losing myself in movies. My love for games was born the day my first Sega console lit up the screen in my childhood room. From Sega to Nintendo, and eventually my first PC, it was never just about playing. It was about feeling the pulse of worlds someone made, and imagining how I could shape them too.

That excitement deepened with games like GTA Vice City and San Andreas, which I enthusiastically modifying, replacing textures, remapping sound, decompiling scripts just to experiment. It was digital mimicry, playful hacking, raw creation. Those nights of tinkering were more than fun, they were early acts of design thinking and systems exploration.

Creation was never just a hobby, it was a shelter. As a child, often navigating the world, I found safety in stories, colours, pixels, and motion. The digital spaces I built and explored became my playground, my diary, and sometimes my only friend. Every piece I made felt like a conversation I didn't get to have.

This passion for creative rework, digital storytelling, and immersion naturally led me into game development. And now, in UI/UX, I find myself at a beautiful convergence, blending aesthetics, empathy, structure, and interaction to create meaningful experiences for players and users alike.
